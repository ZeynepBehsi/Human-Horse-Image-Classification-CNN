# Human-Horse-Image-Classification-CNN

This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify images of humans versus horses. The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow/Keras, and data augmentation is performed using ImageDataGenerator.

# Features
**Model Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
**Dataset:** Images of humans and horses, divided into training and validation sets
**Data Augmentation:** Implemented using ImageDataGenerator
**Performance:** The model effectively classifies images between humans and horses
